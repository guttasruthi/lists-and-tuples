sort():

* we can sort a list, tuple, or any iterable using the built-in sorted() function or by calling the sort() method on a list.

* Sorting can be done in ascending or descending order.

syntax:

  list.sort()


```python
cars = ['Ford', 'BMW', 'Volvo']

cars.sort()

cars
```




    ['BMW', 'Ford', 'Volvo']



index():

The index() method returns the index of the specified element in the list.

Syntax:

list.index(element, start, end)


```python
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'rabbit', 'horse']

# get the index of 'dog'
index = animals.index('dog')

print(index)
```

    1
    

Reverse():

The reverse() method reverses the elements of the list.

Syntax :

list.reverse()


```python
n = [2, 3, 5, 7]
n.reverse()


print('Reversed List:',n)

```

    Reversed List: [7, 5, 3, 2]
    

clear():
The clear() method removes all items from the list.

syntax:


list.clear()


```python
n = [2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]

n.clear()

# Updated prime_numbers List
print(n)
```

    []
    

copy():

The copy() method returns a shallow copy of the list.


```python
n = [2, 3, 5]

# copying a list
n = n.copy()
print(n)

```

    [2, 3, 5]
    

Deepcopy():

A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of nested objects present in the original elements.


```python
import copy

old_list = [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
new_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)

print("Old list:", old_list)
print("New list:", new_list)
```

    Old list: [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
    New list: [[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3]]
    

shallowcopy():

A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements.


```python
import copy

old_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
new_list = copy.copy(old_list)

print(old_list)
print(new_list)
```

    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    

Tuple():

A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas we can change the elements of a list.


```python
# Different types of tuples

# Empty tuple
my_tuple = ()
print(my_tuple)
```

    ()
    


```python


# Tuple having integers
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
print(my_tuple)

```

    (1, 2, 3)
    


```python
# tuple with mixed datatypes
my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
print(my_tuple)
```

    (1, 'Hello', 3.4)
    


```python
# nested tuple
my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
print(my_tuple)
```

    ('mouse', [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))
    


```python

```
